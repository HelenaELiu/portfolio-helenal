# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

Planning Materials:

- It would be good to pick something that I specifically have experience in
- The example of a social media for photographers stood out to me. Maybe a dancer social media? Google says there are some that exist but I know lots of dancers and none of them use these.
- Personally I can see the need for a dance-based social media because the main way I find out about events is word of mouth
- For example, I was added to a dancer groupchat, and when I was added I felt a sense of loss that I had not been in it before and had thus missed out on a lot of cool things.
- I would like to focus on dance at MIT/Boston because making a large-scale nationwide platform doesn’t seem feasible given the amount of resources and time I have
- Goal of interviews: Find out if other dancers also find it difficult to find out about dance events and what they think would make it easier to find out about these events
- Candidates:
    - Dancers at MIT: Nitu, Michelle, Nick
        - Pros: I fit into this category, so it’ll be easier to relate and to understand their experiences trying to find dance events
        - Cons: Their perspective might be too similar to my own
    - Dancers outside MIT: Jessica, Nicole, Ashhad
        - Pros: Aren’t students, so the methods they use to find out about dance events are very different (for example, they don’t have dormspam)
        - Cons: Harder to get a hold of because they are employed :’)
- Chose: Nitu, Jessica. One of each category will be a good mix of perspectives, and Nitu and Jessica have different levels of commitment towards dance (Nitu is very serious about dance while Jessica dances more occasionally) so they will provide different feedback.

Questions to ask:
- How do you usually find out about dance events?
- Do you find it difficult to learn about workshops/classes in the area?
- Have you ever felt disappointed to learn that you missed something you could’ve attended?
- Would you use a dance-based social media?
- What features would you want/not want on a dance based social media?
- Why would you care about a dance-based social media?
- Have you heard of Ayoo Dance (existing dance-based social media)?

Nitu interview:
- How do you usually find out about dance events?
    - dormspam but theres too much other stuff on dormspam, also lots of dance teams use instagram stories to publicize but those expire and she doesn’t check those often enough
- Do you find it difficult to learn about workshops/classes in the area?
yes
    - outside mit, she just doesnt know whats going on. she knows tiny village is doing things, but doesnt wanna go alone.
- Have you ever felt disappointed to learn that you missed something you could’ve attended?
    - yes
    - also, sometimes she knows about events but doesn’t know who else is going and doesn’t want to go alone. so she’d love a way to find out if people she knows are going to be there
    - knowingly missing out on events is frustrating, not just unknowingly missing out
- Would you use a dance-based social media?
    - yes bc let’s say u wanna host a jam session or teach a workshop, that would be a good way to publicize your event. also finding out who’s going to other events. 
- What features would you want/not want on a dance based social media?
    - short videos/snippets of dances would be good just for a highlight of whats going on, like instagram stories
    - long form videos are probably not necessary, that’s what youtube is for
    - also a map based feature so you can see whats in your area would be super helpful
- Why would you care about a dance-based social media?
    - nitu cares because nitu loves dancing! would love to be able to meet more dancers
    - also its hard for adults to pick up hobbies in general and this would make it much easier
- Have you heard of Ayoo Dance (existing dance-based social media)?
    - no
- Misc
    - she’s been using an app called corner for finding third places, something like that but for dance would be very useful

Jessica interview:
- How do you usually find out about dance events?
    - she has to google to find studios, but doesn’t know how good these studios are because typically they don’t have a lot of google reviews, and their websites sometimes aren’t up to date
    - seems like more info is available on instagram but she doesn’t use it often
- Do you find it difficult to learn about workshops/classes in the area?
    - yes, and it seems like a lot of these spaces are dominated by super experienced dancers and aren’t very beginner-friendly
- Have you ever felt disappointed to learn that you missed something you could’ve attended?
    - yes, but not extremely
- Would you use a dance-based social media?
    - she would try it but doesn’t know if she would stick with it
- What features would you want/not want on a dance based social media?
    - time + location of nearby events
    - people can set up profiles and mark themselves as attending
    - people can invite people to events (like facebook events)
    - direct messaging doesn’t seem necessary. every social media site has messaging you can just message people there
    - maybe a way to ask people hosting classes about the class, like a little button where you can send in questions
    - short description about genre and choreography would also be helpful, maybe a character limit to prevent it from being too bulky
    - show price of class for low-income users so they can find more easily accessible dance classes
- Why would you care about a dance-based social media?
    - dance is fun and she would like to do it more
    - she doesn’t have as much time as she would like for hobbies due to job, but lowering activation energy for finding dance classes would help
- Have you heard of Ayoo Dance (existing dance-based social media)?
    - no
- Misc
    - currently attends a weekly dance class at a studio, but would also be interested in workshops outside of this class

Nitu Interview Report:

Nitu felt that a dance-based social media platform would be very useful. She reported that finding out about dance workshops and classes was is difficult, and finding out about who else is attending is especially difficult. She stated that she was willing to go to dance workshops alone, but that she was significantly less motivated without other people to go with, which was a factor I hadn’t previously considered but had certainly experienced myself. She suggested a variety of features, such as a map in order to show distance. Her enthusiasm for dance stood out to me, as she seemed very excited when talking about opportunities to take more dance classes. This made me feel confident that there are users who would be interested in a dance-based social media platform.

Jessica Interview Report:

Jessica seemed interested in a dance-based social media platform. She mentioned that Googling dance studios didn’t provide a lot of information, and that social media platforms on Instagram seemed to have a lot more information, but she doesn’t use it very often. Given her experience with web and app development, she suggested a number of features, such as allowing users to respond to invites to events and and to see which other users have accepted invites, building on the ideas suggested by Nitu. She didn’t seem as enthusiastic as Nitu, which made sense given that her time commitment towards dance is much less than Nitu’s, but was intrigued by a dance social media app as a way to increase her time spent dancing.

Design Opportunities:
1. An app with a layout similar to Google Maps, where you can see how far upcoming dance events are from your current location, where pins mark the location of the event. Tapping on the pin shows who else is going, as well as a description of the event. This has the benefit of showing users how far away an event is. Since most people using this app will be people who dance as a hobby rather than a profession, commute time is probably a big factor in whether they attend events, as well as knowing if your friends are attending.
2. An app that lists events that you can scroll through, where each event is a post. The interface would look somewhat like Instagram, but would contain a picture of the dance studio/video of the choreography, and the description would contain the dance genre, as well as some information about the dancer teaching the class/hosting the event. The events would be in chronological order, so by scrolling farther down or using filters, users could know about workshops months in advance so they could mark these on their calendars.
3. An app where dancers can friend other dancers and post about events they’re attending, such as upcoming workshops, weekly dance classes, and dance crew auditions in the area. There would also be a way to “join” organizations, such as dance crew or dance studio, much like Facebook has communities. This would allow people to find out not only about what upcoming events are taking place, but also what spaces and communities exist to connect with other dancers.
