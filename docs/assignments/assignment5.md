# Assignment 5: Frontend Design & Implementation (Alpha)

---

Wireframes: https://helenaeliu.github.io/portfolio-helenal/assignments/assignment3.html 


Heuristic Evaluation:
  - Discoverability:
    - The map wireframe is very discoverable, as it has the same setup as many other map-based apps, such as Google Maps and Find My.
    - The events wireframe looks somewhat similar to the invite wireframe, which is for a specific event rather than all events. The navbar on the left, the title of the page, and the name of the app at the top are all the same. This may confuse new users when navigating between these two pages.
  - Pleasantness:
    - The invite wireframe, which shows how users can use the invite sidebar on the page of a specific event, is a little cluttered. Putting the invite sidebar as the same page as the event may be a bit overwhelming for the user.
  - Fitt’s Law:
    - Pins on the map wireframe may be on very different sides of the map, requiring users to move their cursor very far. In addition, they also have to move their cursor to an area without any pins to deselect their current pin.
  - Situational Context:
    - The navbar on the left side makes the current tab darker to assist users in knowing what page they are currently on. For example, the Events page has “Events” in darker gray than the rest of the tabs, and the Profile page has “Profile” in darker gray than the rest of the tabs.
  - Consistency:
    - Profile picture sizes are consistent across all wireframes. Organizations on the organizations wireframe and events on the events wireframe are displayed with the same size boxes.
  - Information scent:
    - The map wireframe does not give the user any hints as to what each event is (class, workshop, jam session, social event, etc.). Changing pin icons based on the event could help users forage for information.
