User Test 1 Report:

For my first user study, I chose my sister Jessica, has been working as an computer science engineer for the past 4 years. She completed the first and second tasks easily without confusion. On the third task, accept invite, she seemed confused by the fact that the invite stayed on the invite page after being accepted, and wasn’t sure if she had successfully finished the task for a few seconds. Her eyebrows furrowed, and she had a slight frown, before seeing that the invite status had been updated and her expression relaxed. On the fourth task, remove invite, she seemed to prefer how the invite was removed from the invite page, as she nodded when the invite disappeared. On the fifth task, she seemed confused as to why the home page was for videos, as the page wasn’t titled similarly to the rest of the pages (i.e., events page is titled “events”, organizations page is titled “organizations”, but video page is titled “home”). She finished the sixth and seventh tasks easily, and her facial expressions remained relaxed and consistent throughout.

During the debrief, Jessica stated that she thought the layout was uninspiring and could use more color. She also felt that text boxes could be different sizes, as certain input such as event time is a very short string, such as “October 26th, 7-9pm”, but the text box was very large, suggesting to the user that they need to add extra input that isn’t necessary. Overall, she thought the experience overall was intuitive and she had very little trouble executing tasks, but more attention to detail such as the improvements mentioned above would make the user experience much more enjoyable. Particularly, she felt that the predominant emotion she felt was boredom, as she didn’t find the design to be visually stimulating.

User Test 2 Report:

For my second user study, I chose Alan, a fellow MIT student. He completed the first and second tasks without confusion. One interesting thing he did was that he checked the invites page to see if the invite he sent showed up there, before seeing what the third task was. Because of this, he was able to complete the third task, accepting the invite, very quickly because he was already on the correct page. He completed the fourth and fifth tasks very quickly as well. I noticed he was shaking his leg during this, but was unable to tell if it was simply a habit or a possible response to how the app was making him feel. During the sixth task, creating the organization, he seemed confused when inputting the privacy setting because it was input as a string. He didn’t like that he could misspell the privacy setting and it could be anything. This dissatisfaction persisted when editing the organization’s privacy setting, which was the seventh task.

During the debrief, Alan stated that he felt the overall visual design was lacking. Particularly, he thought that more interesting typography choices could be made when displaying the events. For example, the genre is displayed as “Genres: Hip Hop, Fusion”, with both “Genres” and “Hip Hop Fusion” being the same size and thickness. He suggested that “Genres” could be larger and bold to add some visual flair. Like Jessica, he thought that having invites staying on the page after being responded to was unnecessary, and suggested adding a section on the events page showing events the user has accepted invites to, so they can keep track of what’s coming up. He also wanted to be able to join organizations without having the organization creator add him. Overall, he felt that the website was easy to use, but that additional functionality would make it even easier to use, and different visual design choices would make it more exciting.

Opportunities for Improvement:
1. One area for improvement is the styling. This is a mild physical flaw that makes the usage of this website visually unpleasant for the user. One way to fix this is by adding in more color so that the overall look is less gray.
2. Another opportunity for improvement is adding a “Your Upcoming Events” section on the events page. This is a moderate conceptual issue that makes it hard to keep track of which events users are attending, as accepted, rejected, and pending invites are all grouped together on the invite page. Placing events in which the user is an attendee together on the events page would improve the users’ experience.
3. Another opportunity for improvement is adding a way to join organizations. This is a major conceptual issue as currently the only way to join organizations is to be added by the creator. To fix this, we can add a “join organization” button to the organizations on the organizations page.
4. Another area to improve is the input format. This is a mild physical issue, as some text boxes that typically are used for  very short input (for example, price could be “5 dollars”) are much larger than necessary. This is a mild physical flaw. This could be improved by using smaller text boxes for this type of input and using buttons or drop-down menus for input that has a limited set of choices.
